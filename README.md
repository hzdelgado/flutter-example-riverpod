# Appdoptame - Pet Adoption App

An example app with Flutter. I'm using Riverpod for state management, auto_route for routing. freezed, dartz, carousel_slider, and Firebase for authentication.

## Motivation

I created this project to explore and play with the Riverpod package. You're free to use it as you like :).

## Getting Started
```
- flutter pub run build_runner build.
- flutter run.
```

## Things to improve

- Responsiveness.
- Tests - Not full coverage.
